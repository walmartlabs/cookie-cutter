# gRPC Chat

This examples demonstrates how to build gRPC servers with streaming responses and how to read those streams on a gRPC client side.

## How to Run

```
yarn start:server
```

then as many times as you'd like

```
yarn start:client
```

Afterwards you'll see an interactive prompt in each client that will allow all clients to exchange messages.
