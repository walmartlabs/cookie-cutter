### Richer API for Retries

The retry feature that was added in version 1.1 has been extended to allow message handlers and sinks to get access to metadata about the retry loop and overwrite retry intervals.

```typescript
export class MyMessageHandler {
    public async function onSomeInput(msg: SomeInput, ctx: IDispatchContext) {
        try {
            // currentAttempt, maxAttempts, isFinalAttempt
            // are automatically included in all errors
            // logged by Cookie Cutter
            ctx.logger.info("attempting to invoke API", {
                currentAttempt: ctx.retry.currentAttempt,
                maxAttempts: ctx.retry.maxAttempts,
                isFinalAttempt: ctx.retry.isFinalAttempt(),
            });

            await someApi.invoke(msg);
        } catch (e) {
            if (e instanceof ServiceUnavailableError) {
                ctx.retry.bail(e);
            } else if (e instanceof RetryLaterError) {
                ctx.retry.setNextRetryInterval(e.retryAfterMs);
            }

            throw e;
        }
    }
}

export class MySink implements IOutputSink<IPublishedMessage> {
    public async sink(items: IterableIterator<IPublishedMessage>, retry: IRetrierContext) {
        // use `retry` the same way as in message handler example above
    }
}
```

### Evicting In-Flight Messages

Kafka's rebalance protocol dictates that every consumer must complete processing all in-flight messages and commit its offsets _before_ acknowledging a rebalance back to the broker. In order to be compliant with this requirement we added a new feature for input sources that allows them to evict pending messages from the input queue and wait for all messages, that are currently being processed, to complete.

Full compliance for the Kafka input source is currently still blocked by an open ticket in the `kafkajs` side. There is currently a race condition where evicted items may still be around after the synchronization barrier for the rebalance was crossed.

```typescript
export class MyInputSource implements IInputSource {
    public async *start(ctx: IInputSourceContext): AsyncIterableIterator<MessageRef> {
        // --- PSEUDO code for a Kafka client ---

        this.client.onRebalance(async () => {
            // this will clear all messages from the input queue
            // and wait for all other messages to complete processing
            await ctx.evict((msg) => isFromKafkaInputSource(msg));
            await this.client.commitOffsets();
        });

        while (const msg = await this.client.next()) {
            yield new MessageRef({}, msg);
        }
    }
}
```

### MockMaterializedState

You can now test applications with materialized views more easily.

```typescript
function createTestApp(): IApplicationBuilder {
    return Application.create()
        .dispatch(new MessageHandler())
        .state(
            mockMaterializedState(Customer, {
                "customer-1": new Customer({ name: "John Doe" }),
                "customer-2": new Customer({ name: "Jane Doe" }),
            })
        );
}
```

### Better Throughout in RPC Mode

When a Cookie Cutter Applications runs in RPC mode and encounters a Sequence Conflict, it will no longer retry all messages that follow the one that triggered the Sequence Conflict. However, Cookie Cutter still guarantees that the output state is correct, even when competing events are handled in parallel.

| Mode | Guarantees | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Serial | * Ordering<br/>* Correctness of State | Inefficient due to serial nature of I/O, this mode should generally not be used |
| Concurrent | * Ordering<br/>* Correctness of State | Efficient I/O with guaranteed ordering, good for stream processing
| RPC | * Correctness of State | Efficient I/O, handling multiple requests in parallel while guaranteeing correctness of state -> good for gRPC services |

### Custom Handling of Invalid Messages

It is now possible to customize how invalid messages are handled. The example below reroutes all invalid messages to a dedicated Kafka queue.

```typescript
Application.Create()
    .input()
        .add(new SomeInput())
        .done()
    .validate(withValidateJs(...))
    .dispatch({
        invalid: async (msg: IMessage, ctx: IDispatchContext) {
            ctx.publish(msg.payload, { [KafkaMetadata.Topic]: "invalid-messages" });
        }
    })
    .run()
```

## azure

-   use the new retry API (see above) to overwrite the next retry interval when reaching RU limits with Microsoft's suggested retry interval from the HTTP header of the response
-   upgrade to @cosmos/azure version 3.0
-   expose `url` as configuration for Blob Storage (useful for testing with Microsoft's Emulator Docker image)
-   support for message pre-processing for Azure Queue data (similar to the pre-processor in the Kafka module)
-   Allow opt-in to creating Azure queues dynamically on write

## kafka

-   Implemented eviction of pending messages with new mechanism described above. KafkaJS currently does not provide an async callback on rebalance, so this is still not compliant with Kafka's rebalance protocol until that is resolved (see https://github.com/tulios/kafkajs/issues/592), but should already make rebalances smoother for slow consumers and avoid committed offsets moving backwards
-   support multiple bootstrap brokers
-   make session timeout configurable so slow consumers don't trigger unnecessary rebalances.

## kubernetes

-   implemented workaround for watch stopping to work after some time period

## grpc

-   better error message when connection fails
-   automatically retry intermittent errors

## prometheus

-   initial support for collecting metrics via Prometheus

# 1.1

## core

### Redesign of Retry Logic

The retry logic was redesigned to make it easier to distinguish between errors that should be retried and those that shouldn't. Sinks receive a `bail` function as a parameter now that can be called when retries should stop.

```typescript
class MySink implements IOutputSink<IPublishedMessage> {
    public async sink(items: IterableIterator<IPublishedMessage>, bail: (err: any) => never) {
        try {
            await someOperation(...);
        } catch (e) {
            if (e instanceof SomethingThatDoesNotMakeSenseToRetry) {
                bail(e);
            }

            throw e; // this will be retried
        }
    }
}
```

The same concept can be applied to message handlers

```typescript
class MyHandler {
    public async function onSomeInput(msg: ISomeInput, ctx: IDispatchContext) {
        if (msg.apiVersion > 2) {
            ctx.bail(new Error("API version not supported"));
        }
    }
}
```

In addition to this the number of retries per message is now configurable via `IApplicationBehavior` and the `ErrorHandlingMode`_s_ were changed to

```typescript
export enum ErrorHandlingMode {
    LogAndContinue = 1,
    LogAndRetry,
    LogAndFail,
    LogAndRetryOrContinue,
    LogAndRetryOrFail,
}
```

`LogAndRetry` maps to an infinite number of retries (the application fails when a non-retriable error is encountered). `LogAndRetryOrContinue` vs. `LogAndRetryOrFail` define what is supposed to happen if the allowed number of reties is exceeded (either fail the application or continue with the next message). The default number of retries is 5. `LogAndContinue` and `LogAndFail` work the same but set the retries to zero.

### Metric for Number of Concurrently Active Message Handlers in RPC Mode

A new gauge metric is emitted when running in RPC mode that shows the number of concurrently active message handler functions.

### DefaultComponentContext

The `DefaultComponentContext` class was added that can be used as a default by any implementor of `IRequireInitialization` until `initialize` is called. This is mainly handy for unit tests as it removes the requirement to explicitly initialize components with `NullLogger`_s_, `NullMetric`_s_, etc ...

## azure

### Timeout for BlobClient

The timeout for put requests is now configurable for the Blob Storage client.

### JSON Embeddings

JSON Embeddings are now supported by all Azure Cosmos sinks. When the `JsonMessageEncoder` is used for any sink the document in Cosmos DB will properly reflect the JSON vs. storing the JSON in serialized form as a `UInt8Array`.
